## Simple sign up page

A simple sign up page to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I used SCSS for the first time on this project and it was really nice to know more of this technology. I also could practice more the form element and the style. The design was completely inspired by Faustina Puspamurti
on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/15252242-Sign-Up-Page).

## Technologies
